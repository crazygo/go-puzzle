# AGENTS

- `bash scripts/init-dev.sh` initializes the Flutter/Dart development environment for new contributors.
- On macOS/iOS, CocoaPods 1.8.4 is too old for Xcode 16.1 project formats; use Homebrew CocoaPods 1.16.2+ before running `pod install`.
- For local iPhone testing from the home screen, install a Release or Profile build. A Debug iOS build requires Flutter tooling/Xcode attached and will exit when launched directly from the device.
- Keep Apple signing details machine-local. Store per-developer bundle IDs and team IDs in ignored local config, not committed project files.
